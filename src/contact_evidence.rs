//! Contact-channel evidence: for a request that asks for a person's messaging handle, the records that name
//! that person (under any recorded name form) together with the channel, so later corrections and removal
//! instructions reach the deciding model with the value they change. Retrieval only: it selects records, it
//! never reads or writes a reply.
//!
//! Port of `harness/contact_evidence.py`. The Python `render` / `fmt_ts` callback parameters are dropped: the
//! agent always passes `store.render_pair` / `store.fmt_ts`, which are called directly here.
